# lkm-infect

Reimplementation of ["Infecting loadable kernel modules" by styx^](https://phrack.org/issues/68/11.html#article), from Phrack 68.

Technique still mostly works, just minor changes like adjusting to 64bit ELFs.
Didn't need to change the binding to a global, works fine without doing it.
